# Shoryuken

![](shoryuken.jpg)

Shoryuken _sho-ryu-ken_ is a super-efficient [AWS SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) thread-based message processor.

## Key features

### Load balancing

Yeah, Shoryuken load balances the messages consumption!

```yaml
concurrency: 25
delay: 0
queues:
  - [high_priority, 6]
  - [normal_priority, 2]
  - [low_priority, 1]
```

Or you can set them all to 1 for having the same priorities.

- `concurrency` (default 25) is the number of threads you want to make available for processing. 
- `delay` (default to 0) is the number of seconds to pause fetching from an empty queue. SQS charges per request, pause checking empty queues for a while can be a cost efficient strategy.

### Fetch in batches

To be even more performant and cost effective, Shoryuken fetches SQS messages in batches, so a single SQS request can fetch up to 10 messages.

## Requirements

Ruby 2.0 or greater.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'shoryuken'
```

Or to get the latest updates:

```ruby
gem 'shoryuken', github: 'phstc/shoryuken', branch: 'master'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install shoryuken

## Usage

### Worker class

```ruby
class MyWorker
  include Shoryuken::Worker

  shoryuken_options queue: 'default', auto_delete: true
  # shoryuken_options queue: ->{ "#{ENV['environment']}_default" }

  # shoryuken_options body_parser: :json
  # shoryuken_options body_parser: ->(sqs_msg){ REXML::Document.new(sqs_msg.body) }
  # shoryuken_options body_parser: JSON

  def perform(sqs_msg, body)
    puts body
  end
end
```

[Check the Worker options documention](https://github.com/phstc/shoryuken/wiki/Worker-options).

### Sending a message

[Check the Sending a message documentation](https://github.com/phstc/shoryuken/wiki/Sending-a-message)

### Middleware

```ruby
class MyMiddleware
  def call(worker_instance, queue, sqs_msg, body)
    puts 'Before work'
    yield
    puts 'After work'
  end
end
```

[Check the Middleware documentation](https://github.com/phstc/shoryuken/wiki/Middleware).

### Shoryuken Configuration

Sample configuration file `shoryuken.yml`.

```yaml
concurrency: 25  # The number of allocated threads to process messages. Default 25
delay: 0         # The delay in seconds to pause empty queues. Default 0
queues:
  - [queue1, 1]
  - [queue2, 1]
  - [queue3, 1]
```

#### AWS Configuration

[Check the Configure AWS Client documentation](https://github.com/phstc/shoryuken/wiki/Configure-the-AWS-Client)

### Rails Integration

[Check the Rails Integration Active Job documention](https://github.com/phstc/shoryuken/wiki/Rails-Integration-Active-Job).

### Start Shoryuken

```shell
bundle exec shoryuken -r worker.rb -C shoryuken.yml
```

For other options check `bundle exec shoryuken help start`

#### SQS commands

Check also some available SQS commands `bundle exec shoryuken help sqs`, such as:

- `ls` list queues
- `mv` move messages from one queue to another
- `dump` dump messages from a queue into a JSON lines file
- `requeue` requeue messages from a dump file

### Setup Development Environment

A provisioned vagrant box allows for a fast setup of a fresh development environment
which comes with all development dependencies installed.
Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) (if you haven't already). We also
suggest that you make yourself familiar with the general concepts. The documentation section includes
a nice and comprehensive [Getting started](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/) guide.

Start up the vitual machine and log into it:
```bash
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh

Welcome to Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.13.0-52-generic x86_64)..
.
.
vagrant@shoryuken-dev-box:~$
```
Change to the working directory which is mounted at `/vagrant`:
```bash
vagrant@shoryuken-dev-box:~$: cd /vagrant
vagrant@shoryuken-dev-box:~$: ls

bin           CHANGELOG.md  Gemfile       lib          Rakefile   shoryuken.gemspec  spec
bootstrap.sh  examples      Gemfile.lock  LICENSE.txt  README.md  shoryuken.jpg      Vagrantfile
```

These are the actual files and directories of the repository which are shared
with the virtual machine. You can still edit the files directly on your host system
with your editor or IDE of choice. Afterwards, run the tests
inside the vagrant virtual machine:
```bash
vagrant@shoryuken-dev-box:/vagrant$ bundle install && SPEC_ALL=true bundle exec rspec spec
```
