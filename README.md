# Shoryuken

![](shoryuken.jpg)

Shoryuken _sho-ryu-ken_ is a super-efficient [AWS SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) thread-based message processor.

## Key features

### Load balancing

Yeah, Shoryuken load balances the messages consumption!

Given this configuration:

```yaml
concurrency: 25
delay: 25
queues:
  - [high_priority, 6]
  - [default, 2]
  - [low_priority, 1]
```

And supposing all the queues are full of messages, the configuration above will make Shoryuken to process `high_priority` 3 times more than `default` and 6 times more than `low_priority`,
splitting the work among the `concurrency: 25` available processors.

If `high_priority` gets empty, Shoryuken will keep using the 25 processors, but only to process `default` (2 times more than `low_priority`) and `low_priority`.

If `high_priority` receives a new message, Shoryuken will smoothly increase back the `high_priority` weight one by one until it reaches the weight of 6 again, which is the maximum configured for `high_priority`.

If all queues get empty, all processors will be changed to the waiting state and the queues will be checked every `delay: 25`. If any queue receives a new message, Shoryuken will start processing again. [Check the delay option documentation for more information](https://github.com/phstc/shoryuken/wiki/Shoryuken-options#delay).


### Fetch in batches

To be even more performant and cost effective, Shoryuken fetches SQS messages in batches, so a single SQS request can fetch up to 10 messages.

## Requirements

Ruby 2.0 or greater. Ruby 1.9 is no longer supported.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'shoryuken'
```

Or to get the latest updates:

```ruby
gem 'shoryuken', github: 'phstc/shoryuken', branch: 'master'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install shoryuken

## Usage

### Worker class

```ruby
class MyWorker
  include Shoryuken::Worker

  shoryuken_options queue: 'default', auto_delete: true
  # shoryuken_options queue: ->{ "#{ENV['environment']}_default" }

  # shoryuken_options body_parser: :json
  # shoryuken_options body_parser: ->(sqs_msg){ REXML::Document.new(sqs_msg.body) }
  # shoryuken_options body_parser: JSON

  def perform(sqs_msg, body)
    puts body
  end
end
```

[Check the Worker options documention](https://github.com/phstc/shoryuken/wiki/Worker-options).

### Sending a message

[Check the Sending a message documentation](https://github.com/phstc/shoryuken/wiki/Sending-a-message)

### Middleware

```ruby
class MyMiddleware
  def call(worker_instance, queue, sqs_msg, body)
    puts 'Before work'
    yield
    puts 'After work'
  end
end
```

[Check the Middleware documentation](https://github.com/phstc/shoryuken/wiki/Middleware).

### Configuration (worker side)

Sample configuration file `shoryuken.yml`.

```yaml
aws:
  access_key_id:      ...       # or <%= ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'] %>
  secret_access_key:  ...       # or <%= ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'] %>
  region:             us-east-1 # or <%= ENV['AWS_REGION'] %>
  receive_message:              # See http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/SQS/Client.html#receive_message-instance_method
    # wait_time_seconds: N      # The number of seconds to wait for new messages when polling. Defaults to the #wait_time_seconds defined on the queue
    attribute_names:
      - ApproximateReceiveCount
      - SentTimestamp
sqs:
  log_level: debug
sns:
  log_level: info
concurrency: 25  # The number of allocated threads to process messages. Default 25
delay: 25        # The delay in seconds to pause a queue when it's empty. Default 0
queues:
  - [high_priority, 6]
  - [default, 2]
  - [low_priority, 1]
```

The ```aws``` section is used to configure both the Aws objects used by Shoryuken internally, and also to set up some Shoryuken-specific config. The Shoryuken-specific keys are listed below:

- ```account_id``` is used when generating SNS ARNs
- ```sns_endpoint``` can be used to explicitly override the SNS endpoint
- ```sqs_endpoint``` can be used to explicitly override the SQS endpoint
- ```receive_message``` can be used to define the options passed to the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/SQS/Client.html#receive_message-instance_method

The ```sns_endpoint``` and ```sqs_endpoint``` Shoryuken-specific options will also fallback to the environment variables ```AWS_SNS_ENDPOINT``` and ```AWS_SQS_ENDPOINT``` respectively, if they are set.

The ```sqs``` and ```sns``` sections are for keys that will be passed on untouched to ```Aws::SQS::Client#initialize``` and ```Aws::SNS::Client#initialize``` respectively. In the above example the log level of the clients are set explicitly.

### Configuration (producer side)

'Producer' processes need permissions to put messages into SQS. There are a few ways:

* Ensure the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` env vars are set.
* Create a `~/.aws/credentials` file.
* Set `Aws.config[:credentials]` from Ruby code (e.g. in a Rails initializer)
* Use the Instance Profiles feature. The IAM role of the targeted machine must have an adequate SQS Policy.

Note that storing your credentials into Amazon instances represents a security risk. Instance Profiles tends to be the best choice.

You can read about these in more detail [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/SQS/Client.html).
