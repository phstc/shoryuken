Shoryuken _sho-ryu-ken_ is a super-efficient [AWS SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) thread-based message processor.

## Key features

### Load balancing

Yeah, Shoryuken load balances the messages consumption!

```yaml
concurrency: 25
delay: 0
queues:
  - [high_priority, 6]
  - [normal_priority, 2]
  - [low_priority, 1]
```

Or you can set them all to 1 for having the same priorities.

- `concurrency` (default 25) is the number of threads you want to make available for processing. 
- `delay` (default to 0) is the number of seconds to pause fetching from an empty queue. SQS charges per request, pause checking empty queues for a while can be a cost efficient strategy.

### Fetch in batches

To be even more performant and cost effective, Shoryuken fetches SQS messages in batches, so a single SQS request can fetch up to 10 messages.

## Requirements

Ruby 2.0 or greater.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'shoryuken'
```

Or to get the latest updates:

```ruby
gem 'shoryuken', github: 'phstc/shoryuken', branch: 'master'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install shoryuken

## Usage

### Worker class

```ruby
class MyWorker
  include Shoryuken::Worker

  shoryuken_options queue: 'default', auto_delete: true
  # shoryuken_options queue: ->{ "#{ENV['environment']}_default" }

  # shoryuken_options body_parser: :json
  # shoryuken_options body_parser: ->(sqs_msg){ REXML::Document.new(sqs_msg.body) }
  # shoryuken_options body_parser: JSON

  def perform(sqs_msg, body)
    puts body
  end
end
```

[Check the Worker options documention](https://github.com/phstc/shoryuken/wiki/Worker-options).

### Sending a message

[Check the Sending a message documentation](https://github.com/phstc/shoryuken/wiki/Sending-a-message)

### Middleware

```ruby
class MyMiddleware
  def call(worker_instance, queue, sqs_msg, body)
    puts 'Before work'
    yield
    puts 'After work'
  end
end
```

[Check the Middleware documentation](https://github.com/phstc/shoryuken/wiki/Middleware).

### Shoryuken Configuration

Sample configuration file `shoryuken.yml`.

```yaml
concurrency: 25  # The number of allocated threads to process messages. Default 25
delay: 0         # The delay in seconds to pause empty queues. Default 0
queues:
  - [queue1, 1]
  - [queue2, 1]
  - [queue3, 1]
```

#### AWS Configuration

[Check the Configure AWS Client documentation](https://github.com/phstc/shoryuken/wiki/Configure-the-AWS-Client)

### Rails Integration

### Honeybadger Integration

The [honeybadger gem](https://github.com/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-ruby/) integrates with Shoryuken automatically to report failed jobs to [Honeybadger](https://www.honeybadger.io/).

### Start Shoryuken

```shell
bundle exec shoryuken -r worker.rb -C shoryuken.yml
```

For other options check `bundle exec shoryuken help start`

#### SQS commands
