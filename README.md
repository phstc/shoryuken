# Shoryuken

![](shoryuken.jpg)

Shoryuken _sho-ryu-ken_ is a super-efficient [AWS SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) thread-based message processor.

## Key features

### Load balancing

Yeah, Shoryuken load balances the messages consumption!

Given this configuration:

```yaml
concurrency: 25
delay: 25
queues:
  - [high_priority, 6]
  - [normal_priority, 2]
  - [low_priority, 1]
```

And supposing all the queues are full of messages, the configuration above will make Shoryuken to process `high_priority` 3 times more than `normal_priority` and 6 times more than `low_priority`,
splitting the work load among all available processors `concurrency: 25` .

If `high_priority` gets empty, Shoryuken will keep using the 25 processors, but only to process `normal_priority` and `low_priority`.

If `high_priority` receives a new message, Shoryuken will smoothly increase back its weight one by one until it reaches the weight of 6 again.

[If a queue gets empty, Shoryuken will pause checking it for `delay: 25`](https://github.com/phstc/shoryuken/wiki/Shoryuken-options#delay).


### Fetch in batches

To be even more performant and cost effective, Shoryuken fetches SQS messages in batches, so a single SQS request can fetch up to 10 messages.

## Requirements

Ruby 2.0 or greater.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'shoryuken'
```

Or to get the latest updates:

```ruby
gem 'shoryuken', github: 'phstc/shoryuken', branch: 'master'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install shoryuken

## Usage

### Worker class

```ruby
class MyWorker
  include Shoryuken::Worker

  shoryuken_options queue: 'default', auto_delete: true
  # shoryuken_options queue: ->{ "#{ENV['environment']}_default" }

  # shoryuken_options body_parser: :json
  # shoryuken_options body_parser: ->(sqs_msg){ REXML::Document.new(sqs_msg.body) }
  # shoryuken_options body_parser: JSON

  def perform(sqs_msg, body)
    puts body
  end
end
```

[Check the Worker options documention](https://github.com/phstc/shoryuken/wiki/Worker-options).

### Sending a message

[Check the Sending a message documentation](https://github.com/phstc/shoryuken/wiki/Sending-a-message)

### Middleware

```ruby
class MyMiddleware
  def call(worker_instance, queue, sqs_msg, body)
    puts 'Before work'
    yield
    puts 'After work'
  end
end
```

[Check the Middleware documentation](https://github.com/phstc/shoryuken/wiki/Middleware).

### Shoryuken Configuration

Sample configuration file `shoryuken.yml`.

```yaml
concurrency: 25  # The number of allocated threads to process messages. Default 25
delay: 25        # The delay in seconds to pause a queue when it's empty. Default 0
queues:
  - [high_priority, 6]
  - [normal_priority, 2]
  - [low_priority, 1]
```

#### AWS Configuration

[Check the Configure AWS Client documentation](https://github.com/phstc/shoryuken/wiki/Configure-the-AWS-Client)

### Rails Integration

[Check the Rails Integration Active Job documention](https://github.com/phstc/shoryuken/wiki/Rails-Integration-Active-Job).

### Start Shoryuken

```shell
bundle exec shoryuken -r worker.rb -C shoryuken.yml
```

For other options check `bundle exec shoryuken help start`

#### SQS commands

Check also some available SQS commands `bundle exec shoryuken help sqs`, such as:

- `ls` list queues
- `mv` move messages from one queue to another
- `dump` dump messages from a queue into a JSON lines file
- `requeue` requeue messages from a dump file

## Caveats

* SQS provides [at-least-once message delivery](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/standard-queues.html#standard-queues-at-least-once-delivery), which means each job you published could end up being delivered more than once by SQS. That's why it is very important that you design your workers to be idempotent (they should be aware that the job might be worked on or already completed by another worker). Shoryuken can NOT handle this case because different workers don't share the knowledge across different jobs so there is no way to detect the job duplication at shoryuken's level. For more information please refer to [issue#257]( https://github.com/phstc/shoryuken/issues/257).
